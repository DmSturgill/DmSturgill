 👋 Hello my name is Dennis and I am currently working as a Mechanical Systems Programmer using the Axon language to 
perform/automate various Data Analysis and Fault Detection processes on large amounts of Electrical metering data (Think kilowatts!🔌)

👀In my spare time I am re-learning Web Dev. Having used Vanilla JS in college it is my goal to learn Web Development in a modern sense
using frameworks to bring my web programming to a more modern level.

💞️I am open to collaborating on small Web projects of any kind! But am also in the stages of advancing my Web development technical aptitude, so this could limit the
scope of my contribution depending on the project.

Other languages used: 
C++ (moderate amount),
Java(moderate amt.), 
Python(small amt.), 
SQL (moderate amt.),
C# (small amt. for Unity Engine Scripting)
